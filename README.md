# gRPC TypeScript Microservice

gRPC is a modern, high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that enables client and server applications to communicate transparently.
Let me break down its architecture and core concepts before we dive into the TypeScript implementation.

## Core Architecture Components

### Protocol Buffers (protobuf)

- Interface Definition Language (IDL): Defines services and message structures in .proto files
- Language-Neutral: Generates code for multiple languages
- Binary Format: More efficient than JSON/XML
- Schema Evolution: Backward/forward compatible through field numbers

### gRPC Server

- Implements service interfaces
- Handles incoming RPC calls
- Manages connections, threading, and concurrency
- Supports interceptors for middleware functionality

### gRPC Client

- Stub that mimics server methods locally
- Manages connections to servers
- Provides different calling styles (blocking/non-blocking)
- Handles load balancing and retries

### Transport Layer

- Uses HTTP/2 as transport protocol
- Enables multiplexing (multiple streams over single connection)
- Supports bidirectional streaming
- Provides flow control and header compression

### About gRPC

gRPC is a modern, high-performance RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework that can run in any environment.

Key features:

- Uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as interface definition language
- Supports multiple languages
- HTTP/2 based transport
- Four types of service methods:
  - Unary (single request, single response)
  - Server streaming (single request, streamed responses)
  - Client streaming (streamed requests, single response)
  - Bidirectional streaming

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Generate types from proto files: `npm run generate`
3. Start development server: `npm run dev`
4. Run client: `npm run client`

## Development Features

- Hot reloading with ts-node-dev
- TypeScript support
- Protocol Buffer type generation
- Docker containerization
- Production-ready structure

Key Advantages of Using Bun

- Faster Installations: Bun installs dependencies significantly faster than npm/yarn
- Better Performance: Bun's runtime is faster than Node.js for many operations
- Built-in Tools: Comes with test runner, package manager, and bundler
- Built-in Watch Mode: More efficient than ts-node-dev
- Better Compatibility: Handles CommonJS/ESM interop better than Node
- Smaller Docker Images: The oven/bun:slim image is very compact

Potential Considerations

- gRPC Tools: The protocol buffer compiler tools still need to run under Node.js compatibility mode
- Maturity: Bun is newer than Node.js, though it's quite stable for most use cases
- Native Modules: Some native modules might need recompilation

## Running the Project with Bun

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Generate proto types
bun run generate

# Start the server (with hot reloading)
bun run dev

# Run the client
bun run client
```

## Production Build with Bun

```bash
# Build for production
bun run build

# Run production server
bun run start
```
